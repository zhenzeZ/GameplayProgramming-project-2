# README #

This is LAB 11 which is the final lab within the lab series. Over the past few months we've created many different applications. This project defines an Cube, Vertex and Fragment Shaders, Texture and uses the GLM Math Library to perform transformations. As such its a completed 3D cube project with rotations.
Modify this example and experiment with rotate, scale and translate functions (see https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.2/api/a00245.html#ga4683c446c8432476750ade56f2537397)


### What is this repository for? ###

* Lab 11 Experiment with a Cube Texturing All Sides Textured

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone repository
* Ensure `SFML_SDK` environment variable exits
* Ensure SFML Version SFML 2.3.2 Visual C++ 14 (2015) - 32-bit is installed 
http://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.3.2-windows-vc14-32-bit.zip "SFML-2.3.2-windows-vc14-32-bit.zip"
* Download extensions wrangler GLEW from http://glew.sourceforge.net/index.html and obtain Binaries for  Windows 32-bit and 64-bit
	* FreeGLUT can be used as an alternative to GLEW http://freeglut.sourceforge.net 
* Set environment variable for GLEW
	* Follow this guide https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/310519
	* Alternatively `SET GLEW_SDK="C:\Users\#####\glew-1.13.0-win32\glew-1.13.0"`
* To check environment variable is set correctly open a command prompt and type `echo %GLEW_SDK%` the path to glew sdk should be show.
* Download GLM Math Library from https://github.com/g-truc/glm/tags
* Set environment variable for GLM
	* Follow this guide https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/310519
	* Alternatively `SET GLM_SDK="C:\Users\#####\glm-0.9.7.2"`
* Select a project default target `x86` when running executable
* If the project builds but does not `xcopy` the required dll's try moving your project to a directory you have full access to, see http://tinyurl.com/SFMLStarter for a guide on post build events.

### Cloning Repository ###
* Run GitBash and type the Follow commands into GitBash

* Check Present Working Directory `pwd`

* Change to the C drive or other drive `cd c:`

* Make a projects Directory `mkdir projects`

* Change to the projects directory by `cd projects`

* Clone the project `git clone https://MuddyGames@bitbucket.org/MuddyGames/gameplay-programming-i-lab11.git`

* Change to the project directory `cd projects gameplay-programming-i-lab11`

* List files that were downloaded `ls`

### Installation and Environment Notes ###
